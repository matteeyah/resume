\runsubsection{GitLab}
\descript{| Backend Engineer }
\location{October 2018 - Present | Remote}
\vspace{\topsep}
After bootstrapping the Community Advocacy team I went back to my biggest passion at work - engineering software. I joined the CI/CD Engineering team after the 2017 GitLab Greece Summit challenge. The challenge was to develop a proof of concept Web IDE. I implemented the backend that spins up kubernetes pods for development and application live preview and exposes their underlying file system as well as a port to access the preview application at. I work as a Backend Engineer on the CI team to make sure our CI offering remains the best on the market.

\runsubsection{GitLab}
\descript{| Community Advocate Manager }
\location{April 2018 – October 2018 | Remote}
\vspace{\topsep}
As luck would have it I got the the opportunity to manage the Community Advocacy team at GitLab in May 2018. I always liked helping others do the best work they can so this was a no-brainer. As a Community Advocate Manager I built and cultivated a new advocacy team.
\vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
\item As a follow-up from the \#movingtogitlab initiative, I implemented the GitLab Ultimate for Education and Open Source programs.
\item Hired and onboarded a new Community Advocacy team.
\item Overhauled GitLab's Community Advocacy handbook and documented the Community Advocacy process at GitLab
\item Reworked the Community Advocacy process at GitLab to be more transparent, iterative and collaborative.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{GitLab}
\descript{| Community Advocate }
\location{November 2016 – April 2018 | Remote}
\vspace{\topsep}
I started working as a Community Advocate at GitLab with a mission to cultivate and reshape GitLab's online community.
\vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Implemented custom middleware that integrates Disqus and HackerNews into Zendesk - Tanukidesk.
\item Successfully migrated the Community Advocacy team from the main support Zendesk instance and to a separate Community Advocacy Zendesk instance and administered it.
\item  Improved the Community Advocacy workflow and brought all response time averages below 6h (except Hacker News which had a response time of less than 1h).
